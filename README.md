# PinEarth

> PinEarth
Project developed for our 3rd semester at the Technical High School of Campinas, 2020.

## Front-end
This project's front-end, it's website, was developed in with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework and, of course, Node.js. Besides that, we also utilized an external API called [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for our personalized map, and an open-source library called [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for map handling.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
