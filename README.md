# PinEarth

> PinEarth
Project developed for our 3rd semester at the Technical High School of Campinas, 2020.<br>
It's goal was to create a tourist atractions map utilizing both, ASP.net C# and Vue.js, for it's development.

### [Front-end](./frontend)
This project's front-end was developed with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework and, of course, Node.js. Besides that, we also utilized an external API called [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for our personalized map, and an open-source library called [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for map handling.

### [Back-end](./backend)
In this project, we developed an [ASP.net C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) API as our backend. It's function was to access ou _database_ and return it's data about our pins, so that we could place it in our map.
